The character has to attack the nearest enemy and is only allowed to fight in close combat (melee or unarmed). When all the enemies are incapacitated or dead the berserker has to make an Easy (5) check using his or her normal, unmodified Mage score. If the check is successful, the effect ends and the character drops unconscious to the ground. \nA character who has taken enough damage to be reduced to 0 or less HP is dead or dying. Otherwise the character is knocked out for 2d6 minutes and awakes with a headache. If the roll was unsuccessful, the berserker has to attack the nearest ally but can continue making the roll to come out of berserk every combat turn.
